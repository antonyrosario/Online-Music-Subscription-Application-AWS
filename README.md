# Online-Music-Subscription-Application-AWS
Developed an AWS EC2, S3 and DynamoDB based web application. This project is part of my academic assignments.

Created a simple online music subscription application with a Python programming language using AWS S3 and DynamoDB and hosted it in a free-tier EC2 instance (with Ubuntu
Server 20.04/18.04 LTS AMI).
